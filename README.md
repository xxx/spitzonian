It's kinda dumb  
People aren't gonna buy it

I didn't do any magic. I just did some algebra  
If I had a mountain of gold, I'd be wealthy  
If I had a little piece of gold, I'd feel fine about it

Remember good ol' Table J  
Gammerin' Atcha  
It says "boom" right in there, see?  
Sn2 says "aw, shucks"  
It's convenient to talk like they have a personality to help you learn, not cause they're real people  
They don't have brains. They can't think  
Sn2 says "ah, yum"  
SN2 says "Ah, that's fine." So does Sn1

It says "Yikes! This is even worse"  
It says "I don't care if I can't find somethin' to react with cause I'm doin' this right now"  
It says "Oh sheesh! I can't do that"  
It says "Oh, I can bust in there now"  
It's apt to be fine  
He's a hurtin' turkey
